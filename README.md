# BL code2.0

My second attempt on coding the Beddoes-Leishman model for dynamic stall as it is described in LEISHMAN, J., CROUSE, G., 1989, April. State-space model for unsteady airfoil behavior and dynamic stall. In 30th Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference (p. 1319). The main difference with the previous version is that some of the parameters used in the model are not kept constant, they change depending on the airfoil's regime. This version does not rely on MATLAB's libraries of numerical integration.
